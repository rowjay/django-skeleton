# Django Skeleton

for Django 1.11. Should work with either Python 3.5+ or 2.7 (3.5 is preferred)

## Features
Adds the following on top of Django's startproject template

* A set of starter html templates using bootstrap and jquery.

  * `base.html` is a minimal bootstrap template. It also shows any pending Django
    messages from the messages framework, and shows the currently logged-in
    user, and a link to logout.
  * `login.html` has a minimal login form
  * `logout.html` has a logout message and a link to log in again
  * `password_change.html` has a minimal password change form
  * `password_change_done.html` has a success message and a link to the
    'home' view

* A settings file split into a `common_settings.py` and `settings.py` with a 
  separate production settings
* Pulls in most deployment-specific settings from the environment using 
  Django-environ
* Settings configured for a top-level static files directory
* Settings configured for a top-level templates directory
* Settings configured with a good default logging configuration
* A starter `.gitignore`
* A starter `requirements.txt`
* Defined urls for django built-in authentication views (login,
  logout, and password change) and settings configured to use them
  (`LOGIN_URL`, `LOGOUT_URL`, and `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`).
* An oauth app built with oauth2client, for SSO login support
* A deployment script for bundling other dependencies such as static 
  files and javascript bundles
* Sentry support
* Google Analytics support
* Favicon placeholder

## Getting Started
The bare minimum to get a working project is:

1. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements listed in
   `requirements.txt`

   * In this directory, run `python3 -m venv env` to create the virtual 
   environment.
   * Now run `env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * For convenience in later commands, activate your virtualenv for this
     terminal with `source ./env/bin/activate`. You can replace
     `./env/bin/python` with just `python` in subsequent commands in an
     activated environment.

2. Unless you want an app named "appname", change the app name in the following
   places:

   * The app directory name itself
   * In `common_settings.py` the INSTALLED_APPS setting
   * The import statement in the project-wide `urls.py`

3. From the base directory, copy `project/develop/env` to `.env`. No
   changes are needed for development. See the README in the `project`
   directory for more information.

4. Create your database and initial schemas with
   `./env/bin/python manage.py migrate`. The default database is a
   sqlite-based file in the base directory of your project.

5. You now have a working development environment. Run the django test server
   with `./env/bin/python manage.py runserver`

# Deployment Guide for Production

Our usual setup is to use Nginx, Gunicorn, and Supervisor on production
deployments. For this example we assume you are deploying your code to
/opt/my-deployment-dir

1. Clone a copy of your code to /opt/my-deployment-dir. This should put your
   manage.py at /opt/my-deployment-dir/manage.py.
   
   TODO: update this step with instructions involving the use of the deploy bundling scripts.
   
1. Install Nginx and supervisor system-wide
2. Create a Python virtualenv and install your projectâ€™s dependencies +
   gunicorn into it. For this example the base dir is /opt/my-deployment-dir and
   the virtualenv is /opt/my-deployment-dir/env
3. Create a user and group for your code to run as. For this example we use
   project-user and project-group
4. Create a supervisor config in /etc/supervisord.d/myproject.ini containing:

   ```
   [program:myproject]
   directory = /opt/my-deployment-dir
   command = /opt/my-deployment-dir/env/bin/gunicorn --pythonpath /opt/my-deployment-dir/ --bind=unix:/opt/my-deployment-dir/gunicorn.sock project.wsgi
   stdout_logfile = /opt/my-deployment-dir/stdout.log
   redirect_stderr = true
   autostart = true
   autorestart = true
   user = project-user
   group = project-group
   ```
   Note: for production deployments you may want to add e.g. `-w 4` to the
   gunicorn command to spawn multiple workers.

5. Create an nginx config in /etc/nginx/conf.d/myproject.conf (but see below 
if you want an SSL version):

   ```
   upstream gunicorn {
       server unix:/opt/my-deployment-dir/gunicorn.sock fail_timeout=0;
   }

   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name my-hostname.example.com;

       location /static/ {
           alias /opt/my-deployment-dir/static-root/;
       }
       location / {
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
           proxy_redirect off;
           proxy_pass http://gunicorn;
       }
   }
   ```

   Note: You must include the X-Forwarded-Proto line even if not using ssl,
   because gunicorn interprets this header by default, and indicates via
   enviornment variables to Django. So this must be set to make sure clients
   can't fake Django into thinking a request is secure.

   Note: it is sometimes a good idea to put the socket file in e.g.
   /opt/my-deployment-dir/run if you want to have the server run as a
   different user than the user that owns /opt/my-deployment-dir. Then only
   that one directory needs to be writable by the linux user that runs the
   server process.

   Note: If running selinux, nginx won't be able to read the socket file. You
   can give nginx read-write permissions to all files in a directory with
   these commands:

   ```
   # yum install policycoreutils-python
   # semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/opt/my-deployment-dir/run(/.*)?"
   # restorecon -vR /opt/my-deployment-dir/run
   ```
   [Read more about the different context types that RedHat/CentOS uses with web servers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html-single/Managing_Confined_Services/#sect-Managing_Confined_Services-The_Apache_HTTP_Server-Types)

6. Copy the example env file to .env and configure:

   * Set the settings module to the production settings: 
   `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.deploy.settings`
   * If your project uses a local static directory, set STATIC_ROOT
   to /opt/my-deployment-dir/static-root and run 
   `manage.py collectstatic`. If the project is using an alternate
   storage engine such as S3, configure that instead and
   then run collectstatic. (See the project/deploy/settings.py
   for the env variables your project expects)
   * If your project uses a media root, set MEDIA_ROOT to a directory
   that's writable by the web server.
   * Configure the database parameters and run `manage.py migrate`
   * If this is a production deployment, set DEBUG to false and set the
   ALLOWED_HOSTS list to the hostnames you're serving, e.g. "my-hostname.example.com"

7. sudo systemctl restart supervisord
8. `sudo supervisorctl status` to make sure the workers started okay.
9. test nginx config with "sudo nginx -t"
10. restart nginx with "sudo nginx -s reload"
11. sudo systemctl enable nginx
12. sudo systemctl enable supervisord

### SSL Setup

To get LetsEncrypt running on the Nginx instance you just set up, follow
these steps

(adapted from <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04>
and <https://certbot.eff.org/#centosrhel7-nginx>)

1. `yum install certbot` (assumes CentOS7 and epel repos installed)
2. Create a directory somewhere on the filesystem such as /opt/webroot
3. If you have an existing non-ssl configuration, add a new location block to 
your nginx config that looks like this:

   ```
   location ~ /.well-known {
       root /opt/webroot;
   }
   ```
   and reload nginx with `nginx -s reload`
   
   This will let certbot use the web server to perform the domain validation 
   in the next step. You can use whatever webroot path you want.

3. Run `certbot certonly`

   This will ask you for your domain name and web root. If successful, it
   will go ahead and issue you your cert. If you don't have an existing 
   non-ssl deployment (starting from scratch) then choose certbot's "spin up 
   a temporary web server" option for this step.

4. Generate strong dh parameters with

   ```openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048```

5. Modify your nginx config. This is the SSL template for a new deployment:

    ```
    upstream gunicorn {
        server unix:/opt/my-deployment-dir/gunicorn.sock fail_timeout=0;
    }
    
    server {
         listen 80;
         server_name my-hostname.example.com;
         return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name my-hostname.example.com;
        
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/my-hostname.example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/my-hostname.example.com/privkey.pem;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_ciphers "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH";
        ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_tickets off;
        ssl_stapling on;
        ssl_stapling_verify on;
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=6307200; includeSubdomains";
        add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
        add_header X-Content-Type-Options nostiff;
        ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;

        location /static/ {
            alias /opt/my-deployment-dir/static-root/;
        }
        location ~ /.well-known {
            root /opt/webroot;
        }
        location / {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_redirect off;
            proxy_pass http://gunicorn;
        }
    }
    ```

    This makes the following changes from the non-SSL config from above:
    * Adds a new server block for port 80 that redirects to the https version
    * Changes the old block to listen on 443 using ssl
    * Adds a block of SSL configuration.
    
    Make sure to change the hostname in the `server_name` directives and in 
    the certificate paths. Also the web root for the well-known path if you 
    changed it.

   Now test and reload your nginx config

   ```
   # nginx -t
   # nginx -s reload
   ```

6. Add this configuration option to your settings.py (not necessary if
   running under gunicorn; gunicorn looks for this header by
   default if nginx connects from localhost, and indicates to Django whether
   the connection is secure via wsgi environ variables, which Django trusts
   by default)

   ```SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')```

7. Configure certbot to renew certificates automatically:

   run `certbot renew --dry-run` to make sure everything looks okay. If you 
   initially had certbot spin up a temporary web server, you may need to 
   reconfigure it to use a webroot.
   
   1. Open the file at `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/my-hostname.example.com.conf`
   2. Change the line `authenticator = standalone` to `authenticator = webroot`
   3. Add these lines at the bottom of the file:
   
      ```
      [[webroot_map]]
      my-hostname.example.com = /opt/webroot
      ```
      
   4. Run `certbot renew --dry-run` to make sure it works

   Add the following to a file at `/etc/cron.d/letsencrypt`

   ```
    MAILTO=admin-email@example.com
    PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    
    15 10,22 * * * root certbot renew --quiet --post-hook "nginx -s reload"
   ```
   This checks twice a day if the cert needs renewal. You should adjust the exact
   minute and hours attempted to random values, but it's not a huge deal.
   
## Deployment notes and tips:

* By default, Supervisor rotates the stdout log file after 50 megabytes and
  keeps 10 past backups. You may consider tweaking these parameters in the
  supervisor config.

  For some situations, it's more appropriate to change Python's logging
  configuration to have Python log to a file instead of stderr so that Python
  can handle the log rotation instead of supervisor (using the
  RotatingFileHandler or TimedRotatingFileHandler). You will need to decide
  for yourself which makes the most sense for your situation.

  It usually makes sense to have supervisor perform the logging, so any
  erroneous writes to stdout or stderr by python outside of the logging
  system go to the same file. On the other hand, you may want to
  separate them if you want your log files in a consistent format, and you're
  using some library that's being rude and doing its own writing to stderr
  instead of using python logging.

* For production deployments, using Sentry is highly recommended. Make sure you
include the sentry DSN in the env file.
